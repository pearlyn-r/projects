Sequential clinical trials are a type of clinical trial design where patient enrollment occurs in stages and interim analyses are performed to determine whether the trial should continue or be stopped early.​

Objectives:
To simulate a Traditional v/s Sequential Clinical Trial in Python
To compare the effect of the hypothetical medication to that of placebo

Requirements:
Python, Scipy.stats, Numpy,

DataSet used:
Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, Source: Kaggle

Outcome:
Hence Sequential trials provided the same success-loss ratio as traditional trials even after having a much smaller sample space.
A disadvantage of sequential trials is the estimated magnitude of the treatment effect is slightly less accurate than that of conventional fixed-sample-size trials. ​Sequential trials allow for more efficient use of resources by allowing for interim analyses and stopping the trial early if the treatment effect is clear.This can save time, money, and reduce the number of patients needed to complete the trial​
The theoretical properties of sequential trials are confirmed by our simulations and make this trial design advantageous for many clinical trials in emergency medicine.​
